    "### Other material\n",
    "The web is full of material that you can use to get yourself trained in the use of Python. Some suggestions include:\n",

    "* If you perform operations between different types, you do not need to refedine the variable cast.\n",
    "* To print the value of a variable run ```print(variable_name)```. You can print also several variables, just use a comma to divide them.\n",

    "* To know the length of a string use the function *len( )*.\n",

    "* **Arithmetic operations:** \\* (product), / (division), % (modulus), \\** (power), + (sum or **concatenation of lists**), - (difference)\n",
